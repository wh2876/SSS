# Using the command line API to get information about the openstack system I have set up:
Use the CLI to perform the following tasks:
1.	List available instances: "$openstack server list" -> outputs table containing 2 of my instances, "Task02" and "instance2".
2.	Show details of at least one instance: "$openstack server show Task02" -> outputs details of instance i.e. IP, name, volume status, etc.
3.	What is the IP of this instance?: from prev command in "addresses" entry - shows connected network and the device's IP on that network (192.168.0.207)
4.	List the available images: "$openstack image list" shows the list of images we can create, shows ubuntu 2x.04 desktop and server versions, candleos8, windows, etc.
5.	Show details of the “Ubuntu server template”: "$openstack image show "Ubuntu 22.04 Server Template"": outputs details
6.	What is the default password and username? prev command: there dont appear to be any defaults. the Desktop template DOES have student/student as the username and pass
7.	List available flavors: "$openstack flavor list" - base.m1, huge.m1, etc.
8.	Which flavor is the smallest? - base.m1, m2, and m3. all have a size of 10 GB. The larger the number/name the more powerful the machine.
9.	Open Horizon and then go back to stop one of the instances using CLI and check Horizon after you type the command to see what happens: "$ openstack server stop instance2" -> status of instance changes from Active to Shutoff
10.	Repeat the procedure above to start the same instance: "$ openstack server start instance2"	changes to Active, also - like the previous one - starts a Task that shows on Horizon that indicates its starting up or shutting down
11.	What are the available networks?: "$openstack network list" -> lists Task02_Test, network2, and production
12.	Show details of the “production” network: "$openstack network show production" - shows name, activity status, mtu, etc.
13.	Create new network: "$openstack network create consoleNetwork --internal" creates a new network with admin status up, no subnets, and no availability zone set.
14.	Create a subnet for this network (eg. 192.168.60.0/24): "$openstack subnet create consoleSubnet --network consoleNetwork --subnet-range 192.170.0.0/24 --dhcp"
15.	Create another network
16.	Show available networks 
17.	Delete the network created in step 15
18.	Create new router
19.	Set gateway for this router
20.	Add the subnet created in step 14
21.	Create new server and attach it to the newly created subnet in step14. Note that the server you need to create is based on smallest flavor available, using “Ubuntu server template” as an image and attached to the newly created subnet.
