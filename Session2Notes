Quickly want to note I did most of this NOT the day before the lab, it's just that I only got around to making the notes now.

"In this lab we will experiment the role of a tenant’s network administrator." Don't know what this means. Like a housing tenant? Am I a landlord?
"Although, using the command-line interface allows us to have a full control over our cloud environment, however, exploiting a web-based interface by operators and administrators makes it easier to manage the environments and instances."
"Although,"? as an opposition to what? I don't think this comma is supposed to be here and it makes this hard to read because I keep putting in the pause. The "however" after does not fit in well at all. I harbour feelings of anger, frustration, and aggression to whoever wrote this lab.

Anyway, I learned that OpenStack uses a web-service called "Horizon" to make a Graphical User Interface that makes it a lot easier to manage the Internet of Things that you can create with OpenStack compared to doing it through the console.

The last paragraph presents some goals, but it's written badly and it makes me feel 'hate'. "In this lab, you asked to perform some tasks" no I didn't. I did not ask to do that. It should be "you *are* asked" and it makes me angry that it isn't.

## Task 01 - Key Pairs

In this task I must create an SSH Key Pair for use with my OpenStack system. The lab does not say what a Key Pair is ("how does it work? how is it used?") in great detail, only saying that it's used to allow users to connect to their Linux instances without a password.
How does it do that? 

I looked it up and learned that SSH stands for Secure Shell, and is a network protocol that provides a secure way to remotely access a device over an unsecured network.
The reason for this is that sending over the usual username + password combo over an unsecure network has a noticeable risk of being intercepted, stolen, and misused. But with SSH, only one key is sent over the network, and it doesn't matter if someone steals it due to how it works.

The key pair is a public and a private key, and each work as a 1 way encryption, where the public key encrypts something, and the private decrypts it.
This means if somebody steals your public key, which you will be sending over the network, all they can do is get encrypted nonsense that only YOU can decrypt.

Then to access machines, I think it works as such:
- Client: "Hey! Gimme access to this remote computer!" (sending public key)
- Server: "Yeah sure buddy, read this for me real quick: 'x£XSZ~' " (creates 1 time password "Hello!" and sends it post-encryption with public key)
- Client: "Easy: 'Hello!'" (sends it back post-decryption after applying private key)
- Server: "Ok cool come on in B)" (Unencrypted message was received, this guy has the private key associated with this public key!)

This also means that you can import your public keys into anything that uses them, since only the client needs the private key.

## Task 02 - Networks

I created a network as described, and added a subnet (for task 3) with the IP 192.168.0.0/24.
The /24 indicates that there is a mask for the first 24 bits to mark them as identifying the network (each number in the IP has 8 bits - 8.16.24.32 - so oin this case 192.168.0 indicate the network). The bits after the 24th bit identify a specific device on the network, like a port.
