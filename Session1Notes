Opt. Step 0: https://remoteapp.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/
Step 1: log in to https://stack1.aet.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/horizon: domain "leedsbeckett" and usual login info

Task 1 Question: Quote limit information gathering
- Found on Compute -> Overview: 
- - Instances: 5
- - VCPUs: 10
- - RAM: 20GB
- - Routers: 5
- - Also 10 Volumes with total 1000GB storage, 50 Floating IPs,  10 Security Groups, 500 Ports, 5 Networks, etc. etc.

Step 2: log in to https://guac.aet.leedsbeckett.ac.uk, choose a machine, and log in to Openstack again
- I chose the Linux Desktop rather than the shell

Step 3: Go to API Access -> Download OpenStack RC File -> OpenStack RC Fil and run it using command ". Downloads/project_c7571529-openrc.sh"
Step 4: Log in with normal login password
- Whether you type the right password or not nothing visible happens, so you can test if you are logged in with "openstack project list"
- Now can do console commands to manage my OpenStack account and projects!
- command "openstack project list" reveals I have 1 project called project_c7571529

Step 5: Navigate the OpenStack user guides find definitions for DB, API, Schedular, Compute and Conductor.
- I found the definitions by going to End User Guides -> Computer Service (nova)
- - DB: DataBase, in this case it is an SQL database. It is used to store data used by the system.
- - API: Application Program Interface, takes HTTP requests, converts commands and communicates with other components by the oslo.messaging* queue or HTTP
- - Schedular (confirmed from finding the diagram that this should be Schedul"e"r but im quoting): Controller component of the system that determines which host gets each instance
- - Compute: Manages communication with hypervisor (supervisor to the extreme) and virtual machines
- - Conductor: Handles requests that need coordination between components, acts as a database proxy, and handles object conversions.
- *oslo.messaging is a library that facilitates the sending of Remote Procedure Call messages that allow different devices to communicate
- There was another item on this list not mentioned on the lab sheet called Placement, which tracks resource provider inventories and usage.
