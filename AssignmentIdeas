# Assignment Ideas

## Idea 1 (Peak Nap Condition Detection System: Hardest)
- Click Air Flow Sensor 557

- AHT20 Digital Temperature Sensor 867 / DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor

- Soil Moisture & Water Level Sensor Module 828

Used to detect dampness of the ground, temperature, and breeze to see if it's a nice time to lie down on the ground outside in a certain place.

Sensor values are sent to a database which stores recorded values for pattern recognition [not part of project] and comparison against inputted desirable ranges [part of project]

"create a web server and access the sensor’s information remotely in real time." - create a server that provides a graphical interface that has a visual bar-based representation 
for the current values (bars have max and min values set to the highest and lowest the sensors have recorded (or the desired values if they are out of those bounds).

## Idea 2 (Simple Fridge 'Protector')

- Temp sensor

Just detects temperature and sends notification if gets below threshold to warn that fridge has been open too long
