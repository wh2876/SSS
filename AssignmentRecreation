Step 1: Create Network
- Create router
- Create network
- Create server instance
- Connect them all up

Step 2: Open the port

The device added is given a Port in the Network overview. It can be recognised by it's IP!
To allow this device to receive incoming connections in a client-server model, an incoming TCP connection must be allowed through at least 1 port. To do this you must set a security group to assign to this Network Port that allows connection to a specific port on that device.
- Create a new security group and add a Custom TCP Rule and set the port to the one you will use for the incoming/outgoing connection. This can be changed to a range of ports or all ports.
- Go back to the Network -> Ports and Edit Port on the desired device, click on security groups, and assign the newly created security group with the TCP rule. now if you use the allowed ports the client-server will work.

Step 2: Set up pi

Step 3: Connect the 2

- On Openstack, go to router and make note of the IP under the "External Gateway" "External Fixed IPs" key
- Then go to the subnet of the network you have connected to both the router and the server instance and make note of the CIDR under the 

Step 4: ping

ping to the router IP not the instance IP
